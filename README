This repository contains a document describing the proposed Particle
Stream Data Format (PSDF) for N-Body simulations and associated code
in several different programming languages demonstrating the use of
PSDF.  PSDF is optimized for recording the output of general N-Body
simulations that exploit individual timesteps, and is based on the
well-known YAML (http://yaml.org) format for representing data.  

* The "data-format" directory contains a paper and LaTeX sources
  describing PSDF.

* The "examples" directory contains examples of the use of PSDF in
  various languages; the "examples/data" subdirectory contains some
  sample PSDF streams.  You may be interested in 

  - The C example in "examples/C" demonstrating how to use libyaml to
    parse PSDF into your favorite body structure.

  - The Python examples in "examples/Python", which contain several
    routines to generate initial conditions for point-mass simulations
    in PSDF format, various post-processing tools, and a complete
    individual-timestep integrator that uses PSDF based on the Hermite
    scheme.

  - The Ruby examples in "examples/ruby", which contain a PSDF-based
    Open GL viewer, "testplot.rb" that consumes a PSDF stream and
    displays a movie of the corresponding N-Body system.

  - The Haskell example in "examples/Haskell", which contains code
    that demonstrates using a user-defined tensor coordinate strucutre
    with PSDF I/O.
