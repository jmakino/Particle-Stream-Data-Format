This directory contains various Particle Stream Data Format libraries
and utilities written in Python.

Most of the programs will require the PyYAML library to function
properly.  To build the library and scripts, issue the command 

python setup.py build

To build and install the scripts (or install if already built), issue
the comamnd

python setup.py install

You can find several examples of PSDF data files for experimentation
in the share/psdf/ directory.

The library code is organized in a module called psdf.  The scripts
are in the bin subdirectory:

energy.py: Reads a PSDF system from stdin, and prints the total,
kinetic, and potential energy of that system on stdout.

input_output.py: A simple example that reads a system or set of
worldlines on stdin in PSDF format, constructs the corresponding
particle objects, and dumps them on stdout in PSDF format.

plummer_model.py: Produces a plummer model in PSDF format on stdout.

system_to_standard_units.py: Reads a system in PSDF format on stdin,
and prints the corresponding system in the center of mass frame and
standard units (G = MTot = 1, Etot = -1/4) to stdout.
