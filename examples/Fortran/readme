= readme for PSDF fortran interface

Author: Jun Makino

= Overview

This is very simple fortran interface, or wrapper function of Will
Farr's C implementation. It assumes that data I/O is through
stdin/stdout of C. So it might cause strange trouble when used with
fortran unit 5/6 standard IO.


= Initialize and Finalize

      function integer init_psdf_parser

returns 0 if success

      function integer final_psdf_parser

currently a dummy function, which does nothing

= read and write

      function read_body(id, t, m, r, v)
      intger id
      real*8 t, m, r(3), v(3)

reads one particle, and returns 0 if success

      function write_body(id, t, m, r, v)
      intger id
      real*8 t, m, r(3), v(3)

writes one particle, and returns 0 if success
