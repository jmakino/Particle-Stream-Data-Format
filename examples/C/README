This is an example of parsing the PSDF data format in C.  It requires
libyaml.  Edit the Makefile to point to your libyaml installation,
then use 'make' to build the input_output program.  

The input_output program acts as a PSDF translator: it reads a PSDF
stream on stdin, constructs the corresponding body objects, and writes
their PSDF on stdout.  You may find the functions in psdf-body.c
useful in constructing a PSDF reader for your own, custom, body
objects.
